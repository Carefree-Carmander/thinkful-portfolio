        <h3>About Carmen</h3>
        <p>I didn't really have any solid plans after graduating high school.</p>
        <p>I was wholly convinced that I was going to go into veterinary medicine to become a Veterinarian.</p>
        <p>We see how well that turned out...</p>
        <p>But I don't say that in bitterness, more as a wake-up call that I hadn't found what I was truly passionate
          about yet.</p>
        <p>Once I found out about coding and came across Thinkful, I had a realization that this was what I wanted to do
          for my career and am having a ball learning!</p>
        <br />
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, which gives me an advantage:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I've beta tested games so I'm already familiar with the debugging phase of coding.</li>
          <li>I like a challenge and am never afraid to face one head on.</li>
          <li>Being that I'm a completionist, I always make sure my codes are of high quality.</li>
          <li>I've gamed with a variety of people so I can cooperate with many different personalities.</li>
        </ul>
